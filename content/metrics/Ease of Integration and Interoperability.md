title: Ease of Integration and Interoperability
---
- **Why it matters**: The tool should fit well with your existing tech stack. Seamless integration with other tools can reduce operational overhead and improve developer productivity.
- **Metrics**:
    - Supported connectors and APIs (e.g., JDBC, REST, Kafka Connect)
    - Availability of SDKs and libraries
    - Ecosystem compatibility (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Example**: Airflow integrates well with a wide variety of databases, cloud providers, and other tools, making it an ideal orchestration tool. There's no connector for DuckDB in Looker.
