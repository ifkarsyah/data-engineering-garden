title: Community and Ecosystem Support
---
- **Why it matters**: A large community or active ecosystem can be a significant advantage, as it provides access to shared knowledge, third-party tools, and plugins.
- **Metrics**:
    - Community size and activity (GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, forums)
    - Availability of plugins and integrations
    - Frequency of updates and active development
- **Example**: Tools like Apache Airflow and Spark benefit from large, active communities with frequent updates and widespread adoption.
