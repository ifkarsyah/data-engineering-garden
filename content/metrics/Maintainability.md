title: Maintainability
---
- **Why it matters**: The ease with which you can maintain, debug, and update the tool over time is crucial. A tool thatâ€™s difficult to maintain can introduce inefficiencies and errors.
- **Metrics**:
    - Learning curve
    - Complexity of upgrades and patching
    - Availability of support/documentation
    - Logging and monitoring support
- **Example**: Tools like Databricks offer managed Spark, reducing the operational burden, whereas self-managed Hadoop clusters can require significant expertise and maintenance.
