title: Query Perfomance
---
- **Why it matters**: For analytics and data exploration, fast query performance is crucial, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex queries.
    
- **Metrics**:
    - Query response time (for small vs. large datasets)
    - Indexing and partitioning support
    - Query optimization techniques (e.g., materialized views, caching)
- **Example**: Tools like Trino (formerly Presto) are optimized for querying large datasets from multiple sources efficiently, while relational databases like PostgreSQL may struggle with very large datasets.
