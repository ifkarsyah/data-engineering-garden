title: Cost and Resource Efficiency
---
- **Why it matters**: Tools vary significantly in terms of operational cost, which includes not just the software itself but also the hardware or cloud resources needed to run it efficiently.
- **Metrics**:
    - Cost per GB of data processed
    - Compute vs. storage cost trade-offs (for cloud services)
    - CPU/memory utilization under load
    - Network I/O and bandwidth usage
- **Example**: A data warehouse like Google BigQuery has a pay-per-query pricing model, which can be more cost-effective for ad-hoc queries but expensive for continuous workloads.
