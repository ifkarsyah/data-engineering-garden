title: Vendor Lock-in and Portability
---
- **Why it matters**: Consider whether the tool ties you to a particular cloud provider or vendor. Flexibility in migrating data or switching providers is crucial for long-term cost control and adaptability.
- **Metrics**:
    - Ease of migration (e.g., from on-prem to cloud, or across cloud providers)
    - Open-source vs. proprietary
    - Compatibility with open standards (e.g., SQL, REST, etc.)
- **Example**: Using open-source tools like Apache Kafka or PostgreSQL reduces vendor lock-in, whereas proprietary tools like Amazon Redshift may make it harder to switch environments.
