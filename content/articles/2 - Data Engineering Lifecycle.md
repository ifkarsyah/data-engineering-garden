The data engineering lifecycle has to do with the process of turning raw data into a usable form for people such as data scientists, analysts, and machine learning engineers. The lifecycle comprises five stages; generation, storage, ingestion, transformation, and serving data. However these stages do not occur on their own, they are supported by principles such as security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.

## Stage One: Generation

The origin of data in the data engineering of the lifecycle is referred to as the source system. Source systems are systems that provide data to other systems. Examples of source systems are Data warehouses, IoT devices, and Web services. The main responsibility of the data engineer at this stage is to understand the type or types of source system being dealt with, because the type of data being generated, its velocity and frequency all differ between each source system.

Take for example a data engineer working for a large e-commerce company. The e-commerce company makes use of a data warehouse to aggregate data such as sales and customer information. The company also makes use of IoT devices in its warehouses to track inventory levels, temperature, and humidity. They also interact with external web services for payment processing, shipping, and third-party product listings. A data engineer at such a company would have tasks such as understanding the schema of the data warehouse, protocols of the IoT devices, and how to interact with the external web service API (Application Programming Interface).

Faced with such a vast array of source systems, there are a few questions the data engineer should consider, some of them are mentioned below:
1. What is the format and structure of the data in the source systems? (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet, Avro, relational databases, etc.)
2. How reliable and clean is the data in the source systems?
3. What are the security and privacy requirements for accessing and handling data from the source systems?
4. What is the volume of data in the source systems, and how is it expected to grow over time?
5. How will the data from different source systems be integrated and made compatible with downstream analytics and applications?

## Stage Two: Storage

To process data you need to be able to store it. When choosing a storage system for a data warehouse, data lakehouse, or similar data storage and analysis infrastructure, there are numerous critical questions to consider to ensure that the solution meets the organization’s needs in terms of performance, scalability, cost, and more. Below are some key questions to consider:
1. Does the storage system offer features like indexing, partitioning, or columnar storage to optimize query performance?
2. Does the storage system offer redundancy and backup options to prevent data loss?
3. Are there options for optimizing costs, such as data lifecycle policies or storage class transitions?
4. Does the storage system integrate seamlessly with existing ETL tools and data processing frameworks?
5. Does it comply with relevant data protection regulations?

## Stage Three: Ingestion

This stage of the data engineering cycle involves the gathering of data from the various source systems. Some of the questions you should consider before building out the system would be:

1. What is the final destination of the data?
2. Is there a need for real-time or near-real-time processing?
3. How will the system be monitored to ensure successful data ingestion?
4. How will the system secure sensitive data during ingestion?
5. How will the system handle failures during data ingestion?

### Data Ingestion Methods

Data ingestion can be carried out in two ways batch processing or stream processing. Batch processing refers to the ingestion of data in chunks i.e. ingesting data at various intervals while stream processing refers to the real-time ingestion of data, which refers to the quick movement of data from its source system to where it will be consumed. The choice between whether to apply batch or stream processing is based on the use case and the expectation of how fast the data should be delivered. Some questions to consider when choosing whether to ingest data using either batch or stream processing are:

1. Is your data generated or collected periodically (e.g., hourly, daily)?
2. How large is the dataset that you need to process?
3. Do you have the computational resources to process large batches of data at once?
4. Is your use case event-driven, requiring immediate action upon data ingestion?
5. How critical is it that you do not lose any data, and how does this affect your choice between batch and stream processing?

## Stage Four: Transformation

This is the stage at which data is converted into an appropriate format for use in tasks such as analytics, machine learning, etc. Activities at this stage include correcting data types, handling missing data, normalization, etc. Transformation can be a standalone stage but this may differ in real-life applications as the data engineer can begin to carry out data transformation right from the point of getting data from the source system. An example of this would be changing the formats of dates to a specified format needed by downstream processes. Some key questions to consider when carrying out transformation include:

1. What transformations serve the business needs?
2. How will the transformation affect data integrity?
3. How Will Changes in Source Data Affect the Transformation?

## Stage Five: Serving the Data

The last stage of the data engineering cycle, serving data has to do with deriving value from data for tasks such as analytics, machine learning (ML), and reverse ETL. Data only has value when it is actively used for practical purposes. Storing large datasets without using them for meaningful analysis or decision-making (referred to as “data vanity projects”) is a significant risk for companies. There is a need to understand the ultimate business purpose of the data at every stage of the data engineering lifecycle.

## Undercurrents of the Data Engineering LifeCycle

Undercurrents refer to the practices that help in supporting the data engineering lifecycle, these are namely:

1. Security: Data engineers must keep the security of data at the forefront of their minds at each stage of the data engineering cycle. Data security is in summary giving people access to only the data needed to carry out their tasks.
2. Data Management: In the context of data engineering refers to the practices and processes that ensure the proper handling, storage, processing, and maintenance of data throughout its lifecycle. This involves a range of activities aimed at ensuring data is accurate, available, and accessible when needed, while also being secure and compliant with relevant regulations.
3. DataOps: DataOps (Data Operations) is an agile approach to designing, implementing, and maintaining a distributed data architecture that supports a wide range of data-driven applications. It borrows from the principles of DevOps (Development Operations) and applies them to data management and analysis. The goal of DataOps is to improve the velocity, reliability, and quality of the data engineering lifecycle by streamlining the end-to-end process of data flow from ingestion to insight.
4. Data Architecture: This is a blueprint for managing data assets across an organization. It outlines the structure of an organization's logical and physical data assets and data management resources. In terms of the data engineering lifecycle, data architecture provides the framework that guides the collection, storage, processing, management, and dissemination of data.
5. Orchestration: This refers to the automated configuration, coordination, and management of complex data systems and services. It involves streamlining and optimizing the flow of data through various processes, from collection and storage to processing and analysis. Data orchestration ensures that each component in the data pipeline functions efficiently and in harmony with others to enable seamless data operations.
6. Software Engineering: Data engineering has seen a shift towards more abstract frameworks that simplify some of the complexities of data processing, but the underpinning requirement for software engineering expertise remains strong. This expertise is vital across a broad range of activities from coding and testing to developing open-source tools, managing infrastructure, and setting up data pipelines. Data engineers need to maintain a balance between leveraging existing tools and frameworks and developing new ones to meet the unique demands of their data processing workflows.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the data engineering lifecycle is a critical and multifaceted process that is essential for transforming raw data into valuable insights and operational intelligence. Each of the five stages—generation, storage, ingestion, transformation, and serving—plays a distinct role in the journey of data from its raw form to a state where it can effectively inform decision-making and strategic initiatives.

The underpinning principles of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering are not mere backdrops but are integral to the successful implementation of each stage, ensuring that data remains secure, reliable, and fit for purpose throughout its lifecycle. Data engineers, therefore, must navigate a complex interplay of technical challenges, evolving tools, and strategic considerations to deliver data solutions that drive value and innovation.
