Following the generation of data, a crucial phase emerges – the transfer of data for storage. This pivotal process, known as data ingestion, bridges the gap between data creation and its subsequent storage. Our exploration delves into this intermediary stage, highlighting essential engineering considerations, and prominent ingestion patterns. A subsequent article will discuss the technologies facilitating this phase, and the broader context within the data engineering lifecycle.

## Key Terms

### Data Ingestion

This process entails the movement of data from its origin to a designated storage location. Understanding this concept is fundamental to grasping the lifecycle of data engineering.

### Data Integration

A process distinct from data ingestion, data integration involves amalgamating data from diverse sources, such as web analytics, advertising analytics, and customer relationship management (CRM), into a unified dataset. This integration is crucial for creating comprehensive data landscapes that offer more nuanced insights.

### Data Pipeline

Envision a data highway, where the data pipeline represents the infrastructure, systems, and procedures essential for transporting data from its source to the end service point. It plays a critical role in ensuring data flows efficiently and securely from its origin to its destination, enabling seamless access and usage.

## Essential Engineering Considerations

There are some factors that you need to consider when designing your data ingestion architecture:

### Unbounded vs. Bounded Data

Think of **unbounded data** as data happening in real-time, continuously, just like life events. It's like a river that keeps flowing without any fixed start or end. This could be anything that keeps updating or changing, like social media feeds or live weather updates. **Bounded Data** is when you put limits or boundaries on data. Imagine taking a snapshot or a section of that ongoing river of data and saying, "This is the data for just this week" or "This is the data from just this particular area." It's a way to organize continuous data into manageable chunks, often based on time or some other criteria.

### Frequency

Data can be ingested and processed at various frequencies. There are three main ways to do this:

1. **Batch Ingestion**: Collecting and processing data in large chunks at a time, like a company analyzing all its sales data at the end of the month.
2. **Micro-Batch Ingestion**: Similar to batch but with smaller chunks and more frequent processing.
3. **Real-Time Ingestion**: Continuously collecting and processing data as it comes in, like a fitness tracker updating your activity in an app instantly. However, note that in real-time ingestion there is still a slight delay between the delivery of data from the database to its target system.

### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Ingestion

**Synchronous ingestion** is like a single-file line where each step depends on the previous one, while **Asynchronous ingestion** is like multiple processes working independently, handling data pieces as they come, which is generally more efficient and flexible.

### Serialization and Deserialization

**Serialization** is like packing your data into a box for shipping. It's preparing the data so it can be easily moved or stored. **Deserialization** is like unpacking the box when it arrives. It's about converting the data back into a format that can be used at its new location.

It's important to ensure that the destination can unpack (deserialize) the data correctly. Otherwise, the data arrives but can't be used properly.

### Throughput and Scalability

Data ingestion is like a highway for data. Ideally, this highway should never get too congested, but in real life, it often does. As you get more data, the system needs to be able to handle it without slowing down. This means:

1. **Scaling:** Your system should be able to grow or shrink to match the amount of data coming in.
2. **Source Issues:** Be aware of problems where your data is coming from. If there's a sudden rush of data, your system needs to be able to cope.
3. **Handling Bursts:** Data often comes in unevenly. You need a buffer to handle sudden spikes so you don't lose data.
4. **Automation:** Use automated services to adjust your system's capacity, rather than doing it manually. It saves time and is less prone to errors.

### Reliability and Durability

1. **Reliability:** This is about making sure the system that moves your data (data ingestion) is usually running smoothly and has a backup plan if something goes wrong.
2. **Durability:** This means ensuring your data doesn’t get lost or damaged during the moving process.

Sometimes, if the data isn't moved correctly the first time, you can't get it back. So, a reliable system helps keep your data safe. However, creating a system with lots of backups and safeguards can be expensive and complex. You have to balance the cost and effort with how critical it is to keep your data safe. Remember, no system can handle every disaster, so it's important to continuously assess the risks and costs.

### Payload

When you're moving data, the 'payload' is the data you're dealing with. It has several important features:

1. **Kind:** The type of data (like images, videos, or text) and its format (like CSV for tables or JPG for images).
2. **Shape:** The dimensions of the data. For example, images have width, height, and colour depth, while tables have rows and columns.
3. **Size:** How large the data is, which can vary from very small to extremely large.
4. **Schema and Data Types:** This is the structure or organization of the data, important for certain types like tables.
5. **Metadata:** Additional information about the data that helps in its use and understanding.

Knowing these aspects is key to effectively moving, storing, and using your data. Data engineers need to consider these characteristics from the beginning to manage the data properly.

### Push vs. Pull vs. Poll Patterns

In data engineering, there are different ways to move data from where it's created to where it needs to go. Two common strategies are 'push' and 'pull', and there's also a method called 'polling':

1. **Push Strategy:** Imagine the source of your data (like a sensor or an app) is like a person who sends packages (data) to someone else (the destination) without being asked. The source system actively sends data to the target system.
2. **Pull Strategy:** In this case, it's like the destination is a person who goes to the source and picks up the packages (data) themselves. The target system actively reads or retrieves data from the source system.
3. **Polling:** This is a bit like someone regularly checking their mailbox to see if there's any new mail. The destination periodically checks the source for new data, and if it finds any, it pulls it, just like in the pull strategy.

The lines between push and pull can sometimes be blurry, as the methods can overlap or be used together depending on the situation.

## Batch Ingestion Patterns

Batch ingestion means simply gathering data in bulk for processing based on time or size. Some of the patterns that follow this concept are:

1. **Snapshot or Differential Extraction**: Snapshot involves capturing the entire state of the database before processing while differential extraction is only getting the new updates that have occurred since the last time you checked the database.
2. **File-Bases Export and Ingestion:** In this pattern of batch ingestion, data is exported in a file through transfer protocols like object storage, secure copy, or secure file transfer protocol to the target system.
3. **ETL vs. ELT**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) involves extracting data from source systems, transforming it to fit operational needs, and then loading it into a target database or data warehouse. ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) is similar to ETL, but here the data is first extracted from the source systems and directly loaded into the target system, where the transformation then takes place.
4. **Inserts, Updates, and Batch Size:** This is about how often you update your data and how much you update at a time. Imagine you have a bucket of water (your database). Adding water one cup at a time (small batch) is less efficient than adding a whole gallon at once (large batch).
5. **Data Migration:** Think of this as moving to a new house. You need to take all your stuff (data) from your old house (old database) to the new one. You have to pack everything up, maybe into a moving truck (bulk transfer), and unpack it at the new place. You also need to make sure everything fits nicely in the new house, just like making sure your data works well in the new database.

## Navigating the Complexities of Event Data Ingestion

In the dynamic world of data streaming and processing, understanding and managing event data ingestion is crucial. This process can be likened to handling a continuous, unpredictable stream of letters in various formats and sizes. Let's break down the key considerations:

1. **Adapting to Changing Data Formats**: Much like receiving letters with ever-changing layouts, data formats can vary over time. This scenario, known as schema evolution, requires flexibility and a robust tracking system to ensure that data continues to be processed efficiently.
2. **Dealing with Late-Arriving Data**: Just as some letters may arrive later than expected, data too can be delayed due to various factors. Recognizing and setting boundaries for how late data can be accepted is vital for maintaining the integrity of real-time processing.
3. **Managing Out of Order and Repeat Messages**: The challenge here is akin to receiving letters out of sequence or multiple copies of the same letter. Ensuring that messages are processed in the correct order and not redundantly is crucial for accurate data analysis.
4. **Revisiting Past Data (Replay)**: Similar to rereading old letters for valuable information, the ability to access and reprocess historical data is a key feature in many streaming platforms.
5. **Determining Data Retention Duration (Time to Live)**: Deciding how long to keep data before it’s discarded is akin to managing the lifecycle of letters in your mailbox. Balancing the need for immediate access against the risk of clutter is a delicate task.
6. **Accommodating Various Message Sizes**: Ensuring the system can handle different sizes of data packets is as important as having a mailbox that accommodates all mail sizes.
7. **Segregating Problematic Data (Dead-Letter Queues)**: When data arrives that can’t be processed, setting it aside in a 'dead-letter queue' for later investigation helps keep the system running smoothly, much like setting aside confusing letters for later review.
8. **Optimizing Data Receipt Methods (Consumer Pull and Push)**: Deciding whether to actively retrieve data (pull) or to have it delivered (push) depends on the specific needs and capabilities of the system.
9. **Strategizing Data Processing Locations**: Processing data close to its source can be more efficient, but it’s important to balance this against the costs and complexities of data movement.
