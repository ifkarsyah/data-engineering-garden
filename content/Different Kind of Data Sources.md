title: Different Kind of Data Source
---
In data engineering, the types of data sources you work with significantly influence how you design and implement pipelines. Each source has its own structure, characteristics, and requirements for ingestion and processing. Here's a breakdown of the most common data sources in data engineering:

## Databases

### 1. Relational Databases (SQL)
   - **What It Is:** These are structured data stores where data is organized into tables with defined schemas (columns, data types, relationships).
   - **Common Technologies:** [[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]], Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle.
   - **Use Cases:** Transactional data (e.g., purchases, user activity logs, financial records).
   - **Challenges:**
     - Schema evolution: Handling changes in the database schema over time.
     - Performance issues with large datasets and complex queries.
   - **Ingestion Tools:** Direct SQL Query, [[Debezium]] (for CDC), [[Fivetran]]

### 2. NoSQL Databases
   - **What It Is:** Databases designed to handle diverse and unstructured data.
   - **Common Technologies:** MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, DynamoDB.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - High-velocity data like logs, sensor data, and social media feeds.
     - Applications where flexible schema and horizontal scalability are needed.
   - **Challenges:**
     - Schema evolution: Handling changes in the database schema over time.
   - **Ingestion Tools:** [[Kafka Connect]] (for [[MongoDB]], [[Cassandra]]), custom ingestion scripts.
## From Application

### 4. Message Brokers/Queues
   - **What It Is:** Distributed systems used for sending and receiving messages between systems, often in real-time or near real-time.
   - **Common Technologies:** Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - Stream processing of high-velocity data such as clickstreams, logs, IoT devices.
     - Event-driven architectures where systems are loosely coupled.
   - **Challenges:**
     - Message ordering and deduplication in high-throughput environments.
     - Scalability and fault tolerance for long-running streams.
   - **Ingestion Tools:** [[Kafka Streams]], [[Apache Flink]], [[Spark Streaming]], custom consumer applications.
### 8. Logs and Event Data
   - **What It Is:** Real-time or near real-time logs generated by systems, applications, servers, and services.
   - **Common Technologies:** ElasticSearch (ELK Stack), Fluentd, Logstash, Prometheus.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - Monitoring, troubleshooting, and alerting on system and application health.
     - Building analytics pipelines from web server logs (e.g., clickstream data).
   - **Challenges:**
     - High velocity and volume of logs generated by large-scale distributed systems.
     - Handling real-time processing and storage costs.
   - **Ingestion Tools:** [[Apache Kafka]], Fluentd, Logstash, Beats.
## Files

### 5. Object Storage
   - **What It Is:** Unstructured or semi-structured data stored as objects (files, blobs).
   - **Common Technologies:** AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Azure Blob Storage, HDFS.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - Storing logs, backup files, images, videos, and large datasets.
     - Data lakes used for batch processing and analytics.
   - **Challenges:**
     - Efficient retrieval of data for analytics (e.g., partitioning, indexing).
     - Managing large-scale file systems and reducing storage costs.
   - **Ingestion Tools:** [[AWS Glue]], Google Cloud Dataflow, [[Apache Spark]], custom Python/Java scripts.
### 7. File-Based Sources
   - **What It Is:** Flat files, such as CSVs, Excel spreadsheets, JSON, Parquet, or Avro.
   - **Common Use Cases:** CSV/Excel files for simple data dumps, Parquet for optimized storage and query performance in data lakes.
   - **Challenges:**
     - Handling different file formats and encoding.
     - Managing large volumes of files and handling schema evolution in semi-structured formats like JSON.
   - **Ingestion Tools:** Apache Nifi, Hadoop (for batch), cloud storage integration tools.
## APIs

### 6. Third-Party APIs
   - **What It Is:** External data providers offering data through APIs (usually REST or GraphQL) that can be consumed by your applications or pipelines.
   - **Common Examples:** Twitter API, Stripe, Salesforce, weather data, stock market data.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - Integrating external services like CRM, payment systems, and social media platforms.
     - Enriching internal datasets with external, real-time data (e.g., financial data, weather reports).
   - **Challenges:**
     - API rate limits and inconsistent availability.
     - Data integrity and handling errors or partial responses.
   - **Ingestion Tools:** Airbyte, Fivetran, custom ETL pipelines using Python or Node.js.
### 10. CRM and ERP Systems
   - **What It Is:** Business systems that manage customer data (CRM) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) data.
   - **Common Technologies:** Salesforce, Zendesk, SAP, NetSuite, CleverTap, Snowplow
   - **Use Cases:**
     - Enriching marketing and sales data for analytics.
     - Integrating operational data from multiple departments (finance, HR, sales).
   - **Challenges:**
     - Integrating with proprietary systems and handling API restrictions.
     - Ensuring data synchronization between internal systems and CRMs.
   - **Ingestion Tools:** MuleSoft, Fivetran, Talend, custom ETL pipelines.
## Specialized
### 9. IoT Devices
   - **What It Is:** Sensors and devices continuously transmitting data (temperature, pressure, motion, etc.) to a centralized system.
   - **Common Protocols and Technologies:** MQTT, CoAP, Apache Pulsar, AWS IoT Core.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - Real-time data streaming from sensors, smart devices, and embedded systems.
     - Use in industrial IoT, smart cities, or connected vehicles.
   - **Challenges:**
     - Managing high-velocity, high-volume data streams.
     - Data consistency and reliability in distributed environments.
   - **Ingestion Tools:** Kafka Streams, AWS IoT, Flink for real-time processing.



By understanding the different types of data sources and their unique characteristics, data engineers can design pipelines that meet performance, scalability, and reliability requirements for various use cases. Each data source may also require different tools and technologies for efficient ingestion, processing, and analysis.
