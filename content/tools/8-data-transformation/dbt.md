**data build tool** (**dbt**) is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software") command line tool that helps analysts and engineers [transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation "Data transformation") data in their [warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse "Data warehouse") more effectively.

It started at [RJMetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJMetrics "RJMetrics") in 2016 as a solution to add basic transformation capabilities to Stitch (acquired by Talend in 2018). The earliest versions of dbt allowed analysts to contribute to the data transformation process following the best practices of software engineering.
