Absolutely! When comparing "build vs. buy" solutions, the cost of employee salaries (along with their time and effort) should definitely be factored in. A longer build time means more salary expenses, which could offset the savings you might think you're getting by not purchasing a solution.

Other things to keep in mind:

- Opportunity cost: Time spent building means delayed value and missed opportunities to work on other important projects.
- Maintenance: Building requires ongoing support, which also consumes resources.
- Expertise: Does your team have the right skills, or will you need to invest in training?
- Scalability: Buying a solution may offer better scalability and reliability sooner.

Balancing these factors helps make a more informed decision.
