## Question

[Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/) supports multiple runner backends, including Apache Spark and Flink. I'm familiar with Spark/Flink and I'm trying to see the pros/cons of Beam for batch processing.

Looking at the [Beam word count example](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/wordcount-example/), it feels it is very similar to the native Spark/Flink equivalents, maybe with a slightly more verbose syntax.

I currently don't see a big benefit of choosing Beam over Spark/Flink for such a task. The only observations I can make so far:

- Pro: Abstraction over different execution backends.
- Con: This abstraction comes at the price of having less control over what exactly is executed in Spark/Flink.

Are there better examples that highlight other pros/cons of the Beam model? Is there any information on how the loss of control affects performance?

Note that I'm not asking for differences in the streaming aspects, which are partly covered in [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35264441/what-is-apache-beam) and summarized in [this article](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/blog/dataflow-beam-and-spark-comparison) (outdated due to Spark 1.X).

## Answer
There's a few things that Beam adds over many of the existing engines.
- **Unifying batch and streaming.** Many systems can handle both batch and streaming, but they often do so via separate APIs. But in Beam, batch and streaming are just two points on a spectrum of latency, completeness, and cost. There's no learning/rewriting cliff from batch to streaming. So if you write a batch pipeline today but tomorrow your latency needs change, it's incredibly easy to adjust. You can see this kind of journey in the [Mobile Gaming examples](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/mobile-gaming-example/).
- **APIs that raise the level of abstraction**: Beam's APIs focus on capturing properties of your data and your logic, instead of letting details of the underlying runtime leak through. This is both key for portability (see next paragraph) and can also give runtimes a lot of flexibility in how they execute. Something like ParDo fusion (aka function composition) is a pretty basic optimization that the vast majority of runners already do. Other optimizations are still being implemented for some runners. For example, Beam's [Source APIs](https://beam.apache.org/blog/2016/05/18/splitAtFraction-method.html) are specifically built to avoid overspecification the sharding within a pipeline. Instead, they give runners the right hooks to dynamically rebalance work across available machines. This can make a huge difference in performance by essentially eliminating straggler shards. In general, the more smarts we can build into the runners, the better off we'll be. Even the most careful hand tuning will fail as data, code, and environments shift.
- **Portability across runtimes.**: Because data shapes and runtime requirements are neatly separated, the same pipeline can be run in multiple ways. And that means that you don't end up rewriting code when you have to move from on-prem to the cloud or from a tried and true system to something on the cutting edge. You can very easily compare options to find the mix of environment and performance that works best for your current needs. And that might be a mix of things -- processing sensitive data on premise with an open source runner and processing other data on a managed service in the cloud.
    

Designing the Beam model to be a useful abstraction over many, different engines is tricky. Beam is neither the intersection of the functionality of all the engines (too limited!) nor the union (too much of a kitchen sink!). Instead, Beam tries to be at the forefront of where data processing is going, both pushing functionality into and pulling patterns out of the runtime engines.

- [Keyed State](https://beam.apache.org/blog/2017/02/13/stateful-processing.html) is a great example of functionality that existed in various engines and enabled interesting and common use cases, but wasn't originally expressible in Beam. We recently expanded the Beam model to include a version of this functionality according to Beam's [design principles](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/design-principles/).
- And vice versa, we hope that Beam will influence the roadmaps of various engines as well. For example, the semantics of Flink's DataStreams were [influenced](http://www.zdnet.com/article/going-with-the-stream-unbounded-data-processing-with-apache-flink/) by the Beam (née Dataflow) model.
- This also means that the capabilities will not always be exactly the same across different Beam runners at a given point in time. So that's why we're using [capability matrix](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/) to try to clearly communicate the state of things.

Apache Beam offers a unique value compared to using Apache Flink or Apache Spark directly. Here are a few reasons why you might choose Beam:

### 1. **Unified Programming Model**:
   - **Batch and Streaming Together**: Beam provides a single unified API that works seamlessly for both batch and streaming data processing. With Beam, you don't need to worry about switching between APIs when handling real-time data versus batch data. Flink and Spark offer both batch and streaming, but with distinct APIs and approaches, whereas Beam abstracts this difference.
   
### 2. **Portability Across Runtimes**:
   - **Write Once, Run Anywhere**: One of the biggest strengths of Apache Beam is its portability. You write your pipeline once in Beam, and you can run it on multiple distributed processing engines (known as **runners**), such as Flink, Spark, Google Dataflow, and others. This gives you flexibility in choosing or switching your underlying processing engine without changing your code.
   - **Future-proofing**: If your team needs to migrate from one engine (e.g., Spark) to another (e.g., Flink), Beam pipelines remain compatible, which minimizes migration efforts.

### 3. **Abstraction Layer**:
   - **Simplified Complexity**: Beam abstracts away some of the complexity of using lower-level APIs in Flink or Spark. For instance, Beam offers a simplified event-time processing and windowing model that is consistent across runners, while Flink and Spark require more detailed configuration for event time and stateful processing.
   
### 4. **Flexibility in Ecosystem**:
   - **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Deployments**: With Beam, you can leverage cloud-native runners like **Google Cloud Dataflow** or run the same pipelines on **on-premises Spark** or **Flink** clusters. This is useful in multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments where you want the flexibility to deploy workloads in different infrastructures.
   
### 5. **Standardization**:
   - **Beam as a Standard**: Beam offers a **standardized approach** to distributed processing, adhering to models like the **Dataflow Model**. This is appealing if your organization wants to adopt a more formal, standardized way of defining data pipelines across different processing frameworks.

### 6. **Cross-Language Pipelines**:
   - **Multi-Language Support**: Apache Beam supports multiple languages (Java, Python, Go, and more), allowing teams with different language preferences to collaborate. You can write parts of a pipeline in Python and other parts in Java, and Beam will still manage cross-language execution. Flink and Spark each have multi-language support, but Beam's flexibility is broader, especially with cross-language UDFs (User-Defined Functions).

### 7. **Beam’s Advanced Features**:
   - **Windowing & Triggers**: While Flink and Spark support windowing, Beam provides highly flexible windowing strategies (event time, processing time, custom windows) and **advanced triggering** options that are simpler and more intuitive compared to configuring these directly in Spark or Flink.
   - **Simplicity for Watermarking and Late Data Handling**: Beam simplifies the handling of late data and event-time watermarking, which can be more complex to manage directly with Spark or Flink.

### 8. **Community and Vendor Support**:
   - **Strong Vendor Support (Google Dataflow)**: Beam is the native API for **Google Cloud Dataflow**, making it an ideal choice if you're using Google Cloud for your data processing workloads. Dataflow is a fully managed service for running Beam pipelines, providing autoscaling, windowing, and real-time processing capabilities with minimal operational overhead.

### When to Use Beam:
   - If you need portability across different runners (e.g., Spark, Flink, Dataflow).
   - If you're working with both batch and streaming data and want a unified API.
   - If you're looking for an abstraction that simplifies working with real-time data (windowing, event-time processing, etc.).
   - If you're working in multi-cloud environments or want flexibility to move pipelines between cloud and on-prem solutions.

### When to Use Flink or Spark Directly:
   - If you have specific performance optimization needs for a single engine.
   - If you're locked into a particular engine (e.g., Spark on Databricks) and don't need portability.
   - If you're using advanced features specific to Flink (like stateful event processing) or Spark (like DataFrames, advanced SQL queries, or deep integration with MLlib).

In essence, Apache Beam is an excellent choice if you prioritize portability, unified API design, and flexibility in managing both batch and streaming data pipelines across different platforms. If your use case is heavily tied to one engine or you need direct access to advanced features of that engine, using Flink or Spark directly might make more sense.
