Every software Engineer, Data engineer, data architect, and machine learning engineer faces this term when they were to start working on a project. You need to know whether you are starting with a clean whiteboard or reconstructing an existing architecture or framework. These types of jargon you will often face when working in the corporate world

## Brownfield Projects

Brownfield projects generally are those projects whose architecture is already been made or those projects which involve adding features, maintaining the system, or changing the legacy code and development on the older codebase. Generally, brownfield projects require you to have a strong understanding of the previous architecture or the coding environment you can only work on top of that you can keep the technologies that the system has built on.

Many new developers do this mistake and choose to make things all from scratch but it is not feasible from time to time depending upon the situation and the (ROI)return on investment. Suppose you want to build a resume parsing application and want to extract the details of candidates from the resume and get all the details of the resumes of multiple candidates in a single sheet. if I have to make this application it will take up to 6 months and the salary of multiple engineers to work on this and I still may not get a feasible result. 

There is a company called XYZ they are offering the same things for some price which will give better service at a less price and cost less money than if we have to make it from scratch. and any other dependencies you want to build you can build on top of that. It depends on you which side you choose.

so many times choosing a prebuilt system and brownfield projects is a good choice you just have to choose which is better for this current requirement.

**Let's take the example of Instagram**

It was initially built on a framework called Django which uses Python if they hire new engineers or architects they have to work on Django itself and they have to study the whole codebase and understand the architecture. But in increasing the number of users an application cannot only be monolithic and it transitioned to microservices architecture. 

In big tech companies like Google and Microsoft, all the architecture uses multiple technologies many small companies maintain a homogenous architecture and code base but when there come new better, fast, and more reliable technologies that can fasten up the work they have to use different technologies. so they can choose to work from scratch on a particular feature but they have to align with previous architecture and sometimes use only the tools that are already built so that they don't have to make those things from scratch.

## Greenfield Projects
Greenfield projects generally are those projects which give you a chance to start a project or a feature from scratch. These are the projects which do not have any restraint whatsoever they allow you to freely choose any technologies that will fit your requirement and allow you to build data pipeline or architecture from the ground up without requiring the existing codebase sometimes Greenfield projects are made on top of brownfield projects such as when you want to integrate a new project in a legacy system you can by using API calls which require modifications and enhancements.

In Greenfield projects, you can choose your own Tech stack which often has many benefits you can choose the tech stack in which your team works the best and allow the new best practices that are not feasible with legacy code or older data architecture.

When starting with a new project in a startup or small team think carefully about what you need, whether you want to make something from scratch with green field projects options or you want to choose brownfield projects which have already been made and are available in the market for a reasonable price for the same software. It totally depends on the need, budget, and time for that particular piece of software that you need.

But if you are making the project from scratch you need to do it with the best practices and security so that the project does not have any loopholes and donâ€™t give you problem in the future so is better to follow best engineering practices while working with greenfield projects and a team of experienced employees.
